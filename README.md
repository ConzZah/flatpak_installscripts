# flatpak_installscripts

This is a collection of flathub / flatpak install scripts i've made. 

they have the following features:

- 1 click install
- automatic alias creation (in .bash_aliases)
- automatic Desktop shortcut creation + icon (sourced directly from flathub)
- each is fully compatible with Alpine Linux & Debian / Ubuntu based distros.
